ðŸŒ§ Rainfall Prediction - Austin, Texas
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict rainfall in Austin, Texas based on weather-related features. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction, all conducted in google colab.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains meteorological data including features such as:

Temperature

Dew Point

Humidity

Wind Speed

Pressure

Rainfall in inches

This dataset was used to train and evaluate regression models to predict rainfall amounts.

ðŸ§  Methodology
The following steps were taken:

Data Cleaning â€“ Handling null values and data type conversion.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.

Feature Engineering â€“ Selecting relevant predictors for model training.

Model Training â€“ Implemented regression algorithms such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Model Evaluation â€“ Assessed performance using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)

âœ… Results
The Random Forest model provided better accuracy for predicting rainfall values compared to other models.

Achieved low MSE and high RÂ², indicating a good fit on the test data.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Takeaways
Weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and pressure play a significant role in rainfall prediction.

Proper feature selection and data cleaning improve model accuracy significantly.

This analysis can assist in early warning systems and agricultural planning.
