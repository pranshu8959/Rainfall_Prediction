Rainfall Prediction in Austin, Texas
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting daily precipitation levels in Austin, Texas, using historical weather data. The core objective is to apply machine learning, specifically Linear Regression, to build a predictive model and to visually analyze the relationships between various weather attributes and precipitation levels.  This analysis will demonstrate fundamental data science skills, including data handling, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.


Dataset
The dataset used for this project is austin_weather.csv. It contains historical weather records for Austin, Texas, including information such as:


Temperature (High, Average, Low) 
Dew Point (High, Average, Low) 
Humidity (High, Average, Low) 
Sea Level Pressure (High, Average, Low) 
Visibility (High, Average, Low) 
Wind Speed (High, Average) 
Wind Gust (MPH) 
Precipitation Sum (Inches) - Target Variable 
Events (e.g., Rain, Thunderstorm, Fog) 
Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the austin_weather.csv dataset by handling missing values (including 'T' for trace precipitation and '-' for missing data) and converting data types as necessary. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the relationship between precipitation and other weather attributes (e.g., average temperature, humidity, wind speed) and visualize precipitation trends over time. 
Predictive Modeling: Build a Linear Regression model using sklearn to predict PrecipitationSumInches. 
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the Linear Regression model using appropriate metrics.
Methodology
The project follows a standard data science workflow:

Data Loading: Read the austin_weather.csv file into a DataFrame.
Data Cleaning:
Removed irrelevant columns such as Date (for direct linear regression features), Events, and granular pressure/visibility/wind gust columns for simplification.
Replaced 'T' (trace precipitation) with a small numerical value (0.001) and '-' with NaN in relevant columns.
Converted all relevant columns to numeric data types.
Handled remaining NaN values by imputing them with the mean of their respective columns. 
Feature Engineering (Implicit): Used the cleaned numerical weather parameters as direct features for the model.
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Training: Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data. 
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance on the test set.
Visualization: Created plots to visualize actual vs. predicted values, and feature importance based on model coefficients. 
Key Findings & Insights
(To be filled in after your complete analysis)

Initial data exploration revealed the presence of trace precipitation values ('T') and missing data ('-') which were crucial to handle for numerical analysis.
(Add specific insights from your EDA, e.g., "Humidity and Dew Point showed the strongest correlation with precipitation," or "Precipitation events are more frequent in certain months/seasons.")
(Add specific findings about which features were most influential in your Linear Regression model, perhaps relating to coefficient magnitudes.)
Model Results
The Linear Regression model was evaluated on the test set, yielding the following performance metrics:

R-squared (R2) Score: 0.6231
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0886 inches
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.2974 inches
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.2974 inches
The R2 score of approximately 0.62 indicates that about 62.31% of the variance in precipitation can be explained by the features used in the model. The MAE and RMSE provide a measure of the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.

Actionable Recommendations

The current model provides a reasonable baseline for precipitation prediction. To improve accuracy, consider exploring more advanced models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting, which can capture more complex non-linear relationships.
Feature engineering from the 'Date' column (e.g., month, season, day of week) could capture cyclical precipitation patterns, potentially enhancing predictive power.
Investigate the impact of outliers in precipitation data on model performance and consider robust regression techniques if necessary.
For business applications, a more sophisticated model could inform agricultural planning, resource management, or event scheduling, especially if combined with probability forecasts rather than just point predictions.
